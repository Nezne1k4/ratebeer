	<string name="help_whereratings_text">Don\'t worry - they are safe.\n\nAll ratings you have uploading to RateBeer using the old app or entered directly on ratebeer.com are stored on the website. Very soon this app will allow you to log in again and view them. In fact,  they will be fully synchronized for quick searching and available offline access when a connection is not available.\n\nAny offline ratings you had made and not yet uploaded are still stored on your device, in the app\' database. Very soon you will be able to see them again and upload them. Very soon, I promise!</string>
