In fact, when you sign in, they are fully synchronized for quick searching and available offline access when a connection is not available.\n\nAny offline ratings you had made and not yet uploaded are still stored on your device, in the app\'s database. They should be transferred when upgrading the app and visible in your main ratings screen. Very soon you will be able to upload them again, when the rating feature is finished. Very soon, I promise!</string>
